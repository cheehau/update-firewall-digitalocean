# Dynamic IP Firewall Updater For Digital Ocean

## Introduction

As a developer, it's essential to secure your server by blocking access to certain ports like port 22 (SSH). However, if you have a dynamic IP address, it can be troublesome to manage firewall rules. This script helps simplify the process by automatically updating your firewall rules on DigitalOcean to allow only certain IP addresses, including your current dynamic IP.
